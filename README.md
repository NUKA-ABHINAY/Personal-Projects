🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning-based predictive system for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements. Early diagnosis is critical for timely treatment and better management of the disease.

🎯 Goal

To develop predictive models that classify patients as Parkinson’s or healthy.

To compare the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) in disease prediction.

📊 Dataset

Source: Kaggle Parkinson’s Dataset
 (UCI dataset)

Features: Biomedical voice measurements (e.g., jitter, shimmer, NHR, HNR, RPDE, DFA, PPE, etc.)

Target: Status → 1 = Parkinson’s, 0 = Healthy
