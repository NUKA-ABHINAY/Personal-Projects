**Parkinson’s Disease Prediction using Machine Learning**

**📌 Project Overview
**
- This project focuses on building a machine learning-based predictive system for the early detection of Parkinson’s disease using biomedical voice measurements. Early diagnosis is critical for timely treatment and better management of the disease.

**🎯 Goal**

- Develop predictive models to classify patients as Parkinson’s or healthy.
- Compare the effectiveness of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR).

**📊 Dataset**

- **Source**: Kaggle Parkinson’s Dataset
 (UCI dataset)
- **Features**: Biomedical voice measurements (jitter, shimmer, NHR, HNR, RPDE, DFA, PPE, etc.)
- **Target**: Status → 1 = Parkinson’s, 0 = Healthy

**⚙️ Process Followed**

- Data Collection – Gathered dataset from Kaggle
- Data Preprocessing – Cleaned, normalized, and split into train/test sets
- EDA – Analyzed feature distributions and correlations
- Model Development – Implemented SVM and Logistic Regression
- Training & Validation – Used train-test split and cross-validation
- Evaluation – Compared models on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

**🚀 Features**

- Real-world medical dataset used for prediction
- Implementation of two ML algorithms (SVM & LR)
- Comparative performance analysis
- Potential use as a supportive diagnostic tool

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
